# taboo-mon

This is helper code for extracting the Monsanto dataset and parse it up as a series of sentence trees. The trees can be used with [taboo-core](https://github.com/neerbek/taboo-core) (see also this repository for dependencies) which can train and run neural networks for identifying sensitive information.
