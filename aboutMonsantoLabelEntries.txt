==known issues==
Some has no monsantoId,

Document number 44 is contains two entries but they point to the same uri. This an error, I might try to fix at some point

Some of the documents have empty description because the description was embedded in the uriText (because of error in pdfminer). For now we leave it there

We might have a small issue [knock-knock] with encoding/decoding from the original pdf and to filename paths

I haven't manually checked bates (uriText) and description (text) just checked that it seems ok at various points in the data.
